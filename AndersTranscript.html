Conor: Lags a second as I hit record.

Zoom: THIS MEETING IS BEING RECORDED.

Both: *laughter*

Conor: So I've got a couple questions to ask you about masculinity. 

Anders: Alright. As we all know I'm the most masculine cousin. 

Both: *laughter*

Conor: So, hang on, I got to check my notes here. Very professional. 

Anders: I can't work like this. I'm out of here.

Conor: *laughter* So what hobbies do you have?

Anders: Hobbies. Well I write, I play video games, I've been big into Magic The Gathering recently, we had to do this so late since I worked all day and then had D&D.

Conor: Oh fun. 

Anders: So I guess that counts. 

Conor: A lot of my friends do D&D.

Anders: I like comic books, nerd shit, you know.

Conor: Do you consider any of this "nerd shit" particularly manly?

Anders: You know, I've kind of, I grew up and got into this nerd shit in, you know, the 00's when the Marvel thing hadn't happened yet. So people were picking on you for being a nerd so I still have the association of being a nerd, keep it to yourself. But what happens with me is, like, I find that my general interests, the nerdiness, what have you.

Conor: The D&D.

Anders: I don't know if that, like, intersects with masculinity so much because that's not how I think about it. Which I'm sure is a great answer for you, for your paper.

Conor: Hey, whatever you say it's totally fine.

Anders: When I think about the stuff that I do *inaudible* back then there were a lot of people who were pretty insecure about the whole masculinity thing more so than like sports people, they get very defensive of a lot of the stuff. 

Conor: Yeah, Okay.

Anders: I never really felt, like, you know, less of a man or more of a man for playing Magic The Gathering. When I go to magic events they have this weird persecution complex, which is no longer related to social acceptability because they just want to be *grunts angrily*.

Conor: Persecution complex? Huh, okay.

Anders: They feel like they have to justify, this creates things like gatekeeping which creates a whole different conversation. I would hate to be not a cis male and try to get into the things that I'm into because I could politely sidestep those conversations. But even if I want to change it I can't stop other people from having those conversations around me, you know, I'm one dude. If that all makes sense.

Conor: That makes sense. So either in this "nerd" subculture or in your family, just who ever. Are there any idols that you could think of or any people who you really looked up to growing up. 

Anders: Growing up, okay? 

Conor: Or today, whatever.

Anders: Yeah, I'm thinking. Because I... *thoughtful pause* I guess when it comes to idols and that sort of thing, that really never came from participating in the "nerd shit" side because I don't care about esports, I don't care about professional magic players, I care about creators because I want to create stuff. So with magic there's the head designer, his name is Mark Rosewater, he has a really interesting perspective on game design and he answers, like, fifty questions a day. 

Conor: Woah, impressive. 

Anders: About the game and how it's designed and stuff. I don't know where he gets the time to do it, but he does it.

Conor: Eight hours work, eight hours rest, eight hours to shit-post on Twitter.

Both: *laughter*

Anders: He literally saw time during his drive to work and was like "that's time I could be using" and started a podcast. Which he just records sometimes on his drive to work.

Conor: Wow.

Anders: So there's him. Video game sphere, writing sphere. You know there's Tim Schafer, who is a video game writer. He wrote some old adventure games in the nineties and he wrote Psychonauts. He runs Double Fine game studio. I really like him in general. But even with role models, for me it's not like "oh I want to be you as a person" it's more I find your work really inspiring. Which isn't exactly your question but I want to give you an interesting answer

Conor: Okay, thank you, that's good. To you, what does it mean to "be a man"?

Anders: Oh. 

Both: *laughter*

Conor: Yeah, big question.

Anders: That's a great question for me who has just *inaudible* large part of my life. To "be a man" I guess, well, my immediate association is there's this very good video by Chris Fleming on YouTube called "Am I a Man?" because people frequently mistake his gender. He describes being a man as being willing to have a breakdown in public for no reason. I don't think that's what it means to be a man, but that is the sort of thing that someone who prides themselves on being a man would do.

Conor: Yes, okay.

Anders: Being a man is, to me, is having... Without getting into the gender politics of it all, I'm a college graduate too, and I took classes on feminism too. When calling someone else a man it's a compliment, you're saying "that guy kind of has it together", societal conditioning blah-blah-blah. He is able to emotionally move through things effectively. Whereas, calling yourself a man as an immediate descriptor is like "I'm a man!". Which is saying like "what are you afraid of"?

Conor: It's very different saying it about yourself or about someone else. 

Anders: Exactly. If you're saying "I'm a man!" it usally precedes you doing something very stupid. In my experience. 

Conor: Possibly intoxicated.

Anders: The "Hold My Beer" effect, if you will.

Both: *laughter*

Anders: With the fathers we have we'd know nothing about that.

Conor: Oh of course. 

Anders: That's unfair to them, but there is some of that there.

Conor: Perhaps yeah. That's good, very apt description without too much politics or academic language. 

Anders: I'll leave that for the sources you've got to cite. 

Conor: Leave that for the class I'm currently in. I've got two more questions and they're similar. Are there any masculine characteristics that you see in yourself?

Anders: Um. *thoughtful pause* So I don't have have any cis male friends here is Chicago, which mostly translates to no one will go drink beer with me. Which would, of course, make craft beer uniquely cis male in my experience. 

Conor: *laughter*

Anders: You know I enjoy some masculine things, like I don't follow sports but if I go to a sports game I have fun. Or if I watch a game with people I have fun. I like hiking, I like those outdoorsmanly things. I like rock climbing. 

Conor: Oh me too, that's super fun. Wait, but there's no mountains in Chicago.

Anders: I'm looking for a new job so that we can start picking up some more money and there's a gym like two blocks away. So in terms of masculine traits I see in myself, I enjoy things that don't spur as much as the "feminine emotional attachments", but I'm making air quotes just so that you know for the transcription. 

Conor: *laughter*

Anders: So I guess that's my answer, I've got masculine interests. 

Conor: But not perhaps, not those, I don't want to say intrinsic, but those traits. 

Anders: Yeah exactly. I like going to the movies, I like shopping, I like being emotionally receptive to other people. I think that the idea of masculinity has gotten really twisted up, to the point where assigning masculine traits to myself feels weird. Because so many of the things we call masculine traits, are things that I don't particularly value. But hey, I'm a cis dude, I don't have particular doubts about that. But like, we talk about things like, daring people to do things, or being emotionally distant, physically confrontational. None of those things are things that particularly fit me. 

Conor: Yeah okay.

Anders: Because the very idea of having emotions seems to be attributed to femininity, and I'm a relatively emotional person.

Conor: Okay, so I guess related to that is are there feminine characteristics you see in yourself. Do you find it equally strange to applying those to yourself?

Anders: Yeah there's femine traits that I believe I possess, sure. I tend to think emotions first, instead of physicality first. This isn't to say that I'd do well or poorly in a physical fight, but the urge to physically fight someone doesn't come naturally to me. I enjoy social activities, I enjoy the company of others, I go to coffee shops. I suppose up in Seattle that's not masculine or feminine, that's just life. 

Conor: A Starbucks, yeah what're you doing if you aren't at a Starbucks. 

Anders: Well, Starbucks, they're big business, I only go local.

Conor: Of course.

Anders: I guess, you know. I wouldn't call my physicality feminine, I don't express myself in feminine ways. To cite the weird playground thing I check my nails like this *holds hand with palm facing towards himself* and not like this *holds hands with palm facing away from himself*.

Conor: Oh right. That'll be great for me to dictate in the transcript. 

Anders: For the transcript. At first I was holding my hands with the nails... 

Both: *laughter*

Anders: Physically I have a higher voice but I can't help that. I'm a tenor whatcha gonna to do. If we're going to put traits into the masculine box and the feminine box. I would think that most of the way I see the world and things I do in the world would fall into the former. But that's just not how I generally see it. Some of this is informed by the percentage of trans folks I know, gender comes up believe it or not. While obviously that's not all they are, or all they are in relation to myself... 

Conor: It's still a major part of their life. 

Anders: Yeah. One does reflect.

Conor: One does have to do a lot of reflecting to come to that place.

Anders: Yeah absolutely. To my mind, I'm more primarily Anders, more primarily me, not male or female, not masculine or feminine. It doesn't really enter my mind as much. 

Conor: Yes, that's very good, thank you very much. 

Anders: You're welcome. Glad I could help.
