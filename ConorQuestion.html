My final project for WGS245: Feminism, Gender, and Society.

On the homepage of this website you can find my family tree going back two generations on my father's side. There’s also some lovely askii art of a mountain as the background, a theme seen in a number of interviews. If you’d like to make your own you can do that here.

I settled on this for my project for two reasons. First, I thought it’d be interesting to compare and contrast how three generations of Krystad men reflect on their own masculinities, this is why I included each person's birth year. And second, in my WGS class we discussed very abstract concepts such as gender, masculinity/femininity, and the concept of “self”; I wanted to know how men who had not taken this class would interpret those words and the concepts associated with them.

During the interviews I asked six questions, they and the order asked are below:

1. Who was one of your idols growing up?

2. What are some of your hobbies?

3. Do you consider them manly?

4. What does it mean to “be a man”?

5. What are some masculine characteristics that you have?

6. What are some feminine characteristics that you have?
