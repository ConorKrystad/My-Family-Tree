Conor: Hello, who was one of your idols growing up?

Emil: I like how you said "hello".

Both: *laughter*

Emil: Okay.

Conor: Who was one of your idols growing up?

Emil: I was thinking about this and I really couldn't come up with anyone other than Alex Hirsch the creator of Gravity Falls, because when I was in middle school I really want to be a voice actor based on no other factor then that I watched cartoons, I didn't know what it meant to be a voice actor or if it was hard, I just really liked cartoons, so Alex Hirsch was probably my idol. 

Conor: Was there anything about Alex Hirsch that you particularly idolized?

Emil: He made a great T.V. show, he's a redhead.

Conor: Fair enough. What're some of your hobbies?

Emil: I read and I write. And I used to do theatre but I haven't since COVID began, but that used to be my main hobby.

Conor: Do you consider these hobbies manly?

Emil: I don't consider them particularly manly, no. I don't think they're, well, I think theatre is a little feminine in a *limp wrist hand gesture* way.

Conor: I'm going to try and find a way dictate that hand gesture in my...

Emil: that *limp wrist hand gesture* this in a way

Conor: Uh huh.

Both: *laughter*

Emil: uh, yeah, and like reading and writing isn't, I certainly read a lot "girl books" I like to read romances, I read a lot of young adult novels, which, maybe I'm just in a specific, maybe I'm just in a, I feel a lot of young adult authors are female or maybe just read a lot of young adult novels by women. I don't know if that is based on any science or just my personal experiences but I read a lot of female authors. I don't think that reading or writing are particularly feminine or masculine hobbies.

Conor: Okay. Well, in that case, what does it mean to "be a man"?

Emil: I think, being a man is... just who you are. There is no right or wrong way to do it. There's nothing that indicates that you are a man other than your own brain. I am transgender, nothing made me male other than being going like I think I'd be a lot more comfortable if I "changed teams", as the saying goes.

Conor: *laughter*

Emil: So yeah, I think that being a man is just what is in your brain. 

Conor: Okay. What're three masculine characteristics that you have?

Emil: Masculine characteristics?

Conor: Traditionally masculine characteristics.

Emil: Conor, what're three masculine characteristics that I have? 

Both: *laughter*

Conor: Who's doing the interview here?

Emil: No, I'm asking you about how I should answer this question. 

Conor: I think you should think of three characteristics and be like "oh yeah, I do that".

Emil: I get ticked off, very easily. And then instead of like, when I get mad about things I kind of just sit there and fume and I don't have like a place to put it or a person to talk to. Which is also, well, I'm not aggressive when I'm angry, when I get really annoyed by someone I never confront them and I think that confrontation is kind of a masculine trait. But I don't do that, so maybe I said the wrong thing but I'm going for it, that counts as one. 

Conor: Fair enough.

Emil: Masculine characteristics... Conor, what're some masculine characteristics?

Conor: Some of the ones that I think of are like the Boy Scout Code. A Scout is trustworthy, helpful, thrifty, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent. 

Emil: You said thrifty twice *laughter*

Conor: Did I?

Emil: Yeah.

Conor: I always do that.

Emil: You always say thrifty twice.

Conor: Well I'm writing the transcript so I can change that.

Both: *laughter*

Emil: That's true. You know the honest upstanding citizen is a masculine stereotype. I don't know if that's me. I'm a bit too passive to be an upstanding citizen. And passivity is not a very masculine trait. 

Conor: Would you like to move onto the next question?

Emil: Yeah, next question.

Conor: Do you have any feminine characteristics? If so, what are they?

Emil: Absolutely, I'm very passive, I'm very judgemental, I don't confront people about things.

Conor: *laughter*

Emil: Um, I have a lot of feminine interests, I have long hair, I like miniatures, and I like romance, sometimes. Yeah, I try to be soft.

Conor: Softboy hours.

Emil: Kind of, but only until people, like actually say "softboy hours" outloud and then I'm like, nevermind, I don't want to be associated with you.

Conor: *laughter*

Emil: Which ties back to the judgemental thing.

Conor: Oh yes, of course of course. Okay, those are all the questions I have for you. Thank you for interviewing with me today.

Emil: Thank you for getting me out of Thanksgiving dinner for just a couple minutes.

Both: *laughter*
