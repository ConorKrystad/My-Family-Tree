Conor: Okay, uh, hi Eric thank you for doing this interview with me. I've got a couple questions on masculinity to ask you.

Eric: Okay, go ahead, shoot.

Conor: So first one is, who was one of your idols growin up?

Eric: Well, one of my personal idols was probably Teddy Roosevelt was one of them.

Conor: Teddy Roosevelt, the president?

Eric: Right, yes. 

Conor: Why's that why him?

Eric: Well first of all he was the one who sort of started the national parks, established Yosemite and the park program. Which I'm of course a big fan of. But he was also an asmatic.

Conor: Oh really?

Eric: Yeah I had asthma as a child, and so, and he overcame his asma. Just by sheer force of will and a real interest in the outdoors, you know, he was really outdoors, loved being out. And I really respected that. So that's part of what made him my idol, I know not everything he did was great, but, I liked those things. So he was sort of one of my idols because he overcame his asma, and I've worked hard to do that in my life.

Conor: Oh very cool, that representation. Okay. What about, you've touched on it a little bit, what are or were some of your hobbies?

Eric: As you know I'm really drawn to the outdoors.

Conor: just like Roosevelt. 

Eric: Yeah, I find a lot of peace in being out in nature. And so , I was talking at the party last night, we've set this goal to try and set the Pacific Crest Trail, not thru-hike but, you know, over a couple of years. And some people at the party were asking, "why would you want to do that? You're in your sixty years old". And, I mean yeah, if I can't do it that's going to happen, you can't do anything about your age. But I'm most at peace when I'm out walking on a trail in the woods. 

Conor: Yeah.

Eric: That's when I'm most relaxed, you know, you think about how you are in different situations and naturally your blood pressure goes up, you get stressed in some situations and get relaxed in others. And that's where I'm most relaxed and happy, when I'm out walking in nature and that's why it's my favorite hobby. B

Conor: Oh, very cool.

Eric: And skiing is the same thing, you know, same thing, you're out in the woods and so I really enjoy that. Those are the hobbies that I gravitate towards, being outdoors. 

Conor: Do you consider this outdoor hobby manly?

Eric: No. Not at all. Absolutely not. I think it transcends gender. I say that partially because Stephanie, your aunt, you know, she's done a lot of this with me, and she enjoys it as much as I do. 

Conor: She's going to be with you every step of that P.C.T. trip.

Eric: Yeah, yeah. And she's going, and she says she knows we're safer with two people. But she enjoys it too for many of the same reasons that I do. So I really do think that it is gender neutral. In terms of satisfaction you get out of it. 

Stephanie: *incoherent*

Conor: I hear Stephanie in the background there. 

Both: *laughter*

Eric: Exactly. They're out there, hanging out.

Conor: What does it mean to be a man?

Eric: Um, to me, to be a man means to, um, take responsibility for yourself and your actions, and how you treat other people. To be strong and to be, it's a really good question and I'm not explaining it very well.

COnor: Take your time. 

Eric: To be a man is to be honorable, and it's to be truthful, and to be compassionate. To me a real man is, involves empathy, which is an emotional trait that is often associated with females, and you know, maybe I'm odd here, but it's also a masculine trait. That a real man can be objective and can evaluate things, you know we joke about this in the Krystad world, that we're able to view things objectively. Some people might think without passion, but maybe that's part of it. Is to be objective and not to be judgemental but to be fair. 

Conor: To be fair. 

Eric: Fair and object would be high on it.

Conor: So some of those words that I heard you say, strong, responsible, fair, objective, passionate, compassionate. Do those words sort of fit, do you think?

Eric: Yeah. 

Conor: Well my next question is what are some masculine characteristics that you yourself have, do any of those words particularly fit yourself?

Eric: I think I can be pretty objective.

Conor: Objective, yeah.

Eric: And, you now, maybe Staphanie has helped me with part of this, she's a fit masculine herself. Considering both sides, not reacting with an emotional response that's driven by my own standpoint but instead saying "okay where's this person coming from?" and does that make sense, does that fit with what I think is fair or right?

Conor: That almost sounds like, uh, dampening stubbornness. Is that, maybe?

Eric: Well maybe some stubbornness is part of being objective, because you're going to be persuaded by someone going "this is the case" and someone going "oh squirrel!".

Both: *laughter*

Eric: No, I think I see it this way. And I suppose that could be seen as stubbornness as you're not immediately bending, being independent, that's what I mean by object, an independent thought process. Evaluating a situation, or a social interaction, or whatever it is.

Conor: No, yeah. And my last question is what are some feminine characteristics that you see in yourself?

Eric: You know, the first femine characteristic, femine trait that comes to mind is nurturing. You know, being a female to me is being protective, nurturing, caring deeply about somebody who's, being up a baby or a child. And frankly I don't see that much in myself. 

Conor: *laughter*

Eric: *inaudible* that is traditionally a female role, I don't think I have much of that. But I do care deeply about other people and that is a femine trait, because men maybe don't care as much about other people, maybe a little more self-centered. And some people might say I'm self centered, but I do care a lot about other people. Particularly the people close around me, friends and family. So that's probably my primary femine trait, based on how I define a feminine trait. 

Conor: Of course, yeah, perhaps there isn't such a firm line between them.

Eric: Yeah right. I don't think that's necessarily not masculine, to care about people, in fact many of the men which I see in leadership roles that are successful and frankly, are the ones that I respect, are the ones who care deeply about their colleagues and have the back of people they work with. I've always tried to do that in my job, throughout my career, I've always tried to make sure that my people know I have their backs. partially because you care about them and I think that's really important. So I don't know if that's necessarily a femine trait. If you really get me thinking *inaudible* not sure of I answered the question but...

Conor: Oh no, you did, this very good answer. Thank you. It broke up a little but there at the end but I think I got what I came for. 

Eric: Yeah no, I was just kind  of rambling on what's feminine and what's masculine, and I don't see it as black and white at all. Here's your list of femine traits and here's your list of masculine traits and there's no cross over, I don't think that at all. I think that feminine traits and masculine traits have a lot of crossover. There's dozens of traits that make us feminine and masculine and it's a lot more subtle. 

Conor: There's a lot of overlap in that venn diagram.

Eric: Absolutely. 

Conor: And the  trait that you identified as, that compassion and that care for others, might lean a little but feminine but is definitely reflected in both.

Eric: Yeah, and empathy. The classic feminine trait that men don't always do so well and I don't think it's not masculine, just for some reason men, that's happened to me. "Oh, I didn't think they would take it that way"

Both: *laughter*

Conor: Putting yourself in another person's shoes. I've definitely sent a text message and I thought it went one way and the person interpreted it very differently. I was like, I guess when you think about it that you could see how that was not what I intended.

Eric: Yeah, yeah. My experience with females, driven primarily by my choice of spouse, somebody who very much thinks about other people and is always trying to put herself in other peoples position, to the point where she's almost the antagonist going "well what about this" or "well what if they're coming from here". Well, I don't know if that's logical.

Both: *laughter*

Conor: Yeah, okay.

Eric: Yeah, I guess if...

Conor: Well thank you very much, I'm going to stop recording now

Eric: Okay.
