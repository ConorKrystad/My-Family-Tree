Conor: Hell Farfar. SO I've got six questions here, won't be too long I promise. So Farfar who was one of your idols growing up?

Farfar: Growing up. One of my grade school teachers. 

Conor: Grade school teacher? Who was that?

Farfar: Name?

Conor: Yeah.

Farfar: Boy can't remember first name but last was Ms. Eliot, who later became Ms. Eliot-Kilbane. And she was the inspiration for getting educated.

Conor: Oh yeah?

Farfar: She gave me a gift when I finished the eighth grade and went on to high school. 

Conor: Yeah.

Farfar: Me and my sister and a couple friends in the neighborhood kept tabs on her, she taught at Ronald school and shoreline school district was formed and built, when they built a school down in Lake City Jane Adams, or something, that's when we eventually lost contact with her. She was just an inspiration. 

Conor: Why was she so inspirational?

Farfar: She made me read books.

Both: *laughter*

Farfar: She's kind, friendly, and uh, always had your interest at the top of the list. She was just a good teacher. 

Conor: Well, uh, my second question is what are or were some of your hobbies?

Farfar: Hobbies?

Conor: Things you've done outside of work that you've been proud of.

Farfar: You'd have to go back to my childhood as far as hobbies were. I had one responsibility that actually turned out to be a hobby, I had a small flock of bantam chickens.

Conor: A flock of chickens?

Farfar: Yes. These were egg laying chickens. This was running parallel to my Dad who had a chicken house that had upwards of a laying hens. He had chickens and he sold eggs, those types. So I actually had my own chicken farm to provide the eggs for the family.

Conor: Oh cool.

Farfar: Didn't sell them and once a year I'd put a hen on eight to ten eggs and get another flock of little chicks which I had to defend from a feral cat in the neighborhood.

Conor: A feral cat!

Farfar: In the neighborhood, used to get my chickens. But that was my hobby as a youngster in midgrade school during World War II. But beyond that as an adult I got involved in the woods and one of my best hobbies there was hiking, expansive hiking. I had a friend and we'd gather together six maybe eight people and go out on these ten day hikes.

Conor: Oh cool.

Farfar: Fifty milers. And I did that every year for a long time, in fact the last one was in the year 2000. 

Conor: That's really cool.

Farfar: I did that, hiking. I probably hiked sixty-seventy percent of the cascade crest trail.

Conor: Cascades, I'm familiar.

Farfar: We've done all of the northern half, from Stevens Pass north, all of that.

Conor: That's the most beautiful part.

Farfar: Oh it's a beautiful chunk of country, all the way to the Canadian border. In fact we did it with scouts, I think it was in '75 we had the fifty miler head up into Canada. Manning Park I think it was. Hiking the border down to monument 78 on the Canadian border. 

Conor: Oh all the little monuments along the border.

Farfar: Yeah, I'm familiar with 78 and 76. They're up there. 

Conor: Yeah me and my troop went up there and did a fifty miler in the okanagan highlands to see one of those mile posts but we got turned back due to bad weather.

Farfar: Okay. So that was my adult favorite occupation.

Conor: Well it sounds really cool, that's awesome. Do you consider those hobbies manly?

Farfar: Say that again. Manual?

Conor: Manly.

Farfar: Manly?

Conor. Manly.

Farfar: I'm a man, I did them. But hiking like that is for anybody, considering all the different people we ran into on the trail, men and women, never did find a loner women, but met enough single guys doing it from Mexico north, some of them doing it in pieces.

Conor: Yeah the PCT, the whole 2000 miles.

Farfar: Whatever. But in part of that time, didn't even consider it. It was just an activity. In fact, with our church at Haller Lake we've got a group we called the saturday nighters.

Conor: The Saturday nighters?

Farfar: There were ten, twelve, fifteen, guys and their wives. We had many weeks where we went for a weekend trip. I don't know if we ever did an overnighter on the trail. But we did things like going out to the ocean, brought the parents and all the existing kids. I remember we took over one hotel over there in Ocean Shores. We had all our friends. Outdoors, I think was the idea. 

Conor: Yeah, okay. Well my next question is what does it mean to "be a man".

Farfar: Oh my god. What does it mean to be a human? Or a male?

Conor: To be a male.

Farfar: Okay. *pause* A male, you've got me thinking hard. Well over time, we become physically, mentally, capable for the perpetuation of the human race. And unfortunately, in my growing up, the male was predominant and the female they stayed home and took care of kids, did all the grunt work. They were a source of income that sustained them. That's what it's been and it's is changing.

Both: *laughter*

Conor: Yeah I'd say so.

Farfar: It has been changing, immensely. Maybe there's a few of us which respect humanity where everyone's got a part to contribute. 

Conor: Well what are some masculine characteristics that you have?

Farfar: Masculine? That's a doozy, well one responsibility. One is actually, I'm going to call it, moral support. Those that we're around and work with and live with. 

Conor: Responsibility and moral support. 

Farfar: Being responsible for yourself. 

Conor: Well what about any feminine characteristics that I might have?

Farfar: Do I have any?

Conor: I don't know, do you?

Farfar: Well, if you want to call it a feminine characteristic, I wash dishes. But that is not feminine, that's a job that needs to be done. I don't know if I can answer that question. I don't like to set myself separate from them. But what have become traditional feminine chores don't bother me. Like I say I wash dishes and I like a near orderly house, that type of thing.

Conor: But to not put such a strong line. 

Farfar: What is a feminine characteristic? You name some for me and I can say yes or no. 

Conor: Fair enough, that's good enough, that's a good enough answer. Thank you, those are some good stories, I liked your stories.
