Conor: So Lars, who was one of you idols growing up?

Lars: Growing up... Honestly, I didn't really have idols, really, I didn't really idolize anyone, it just wasn't part of...

Conor: was there anyone who you really looked up to? A family member or...

Lars: Of course, of course, but other than that, I was a quiet kid, stuck sort of on my own.

Conor: Yeah?

Lars: I was a lot more focussed on myself and my own world than other people. Idols didn't really come into play until after high school.

Conor: Okay, so who's one of you idols today then?

Lars: Today? Um, it depends, there are certain areas like art, that I've had idols in. Just in terms of how people express themselves, like Beth Kobliner.

Conor: Beth Kobliner?

Lars: She's a sculptor who does animals, animal sculpture but with expressing humanity kinda. 

Conor: Oh cool!

Lars: In terms of that content

Conor: So that transitions well into my next question, what are some of your hobbies? Animal sculpture it sounds like.

Lars: Kind of, hobbies, I mean sewing, music, art, I don't know if keeping plants counts, but I do that now.

Conor: Oh that definitely counts.

Lars: I don't know if that's like having a pet but like.

Conor: Do you consider these hobbies manly:

Lars: No. Not really. Not at all. 

Conor: Why's that?

Lars: I mean, it probably has to do a lot with the history of, and associations with stuff, especially like sewing. Because that's so often seen as something feminine or something for women. When it's, I mean I just think it's a really good skill to have in general and really valuable.

Conor: So you it's sort of the historical associations that makes a particular hobby manly or not.

Lars: Historical depictions, yeah. And also to a greater degree what peopleâ€¦ Like confirmation bias with what people are exposed to and things that fit a certain narrative that people have. 

Conor: Confirmation bias, yeah.

Lars: Confirmation bias, I don't think that's the right one. But, I mean just that people, and I say this just from people and things I've heard from my classes and stuff, but what people are exposed to changes perception of things. Like statistically a lot of car accidents happen, but car accidents might not happen to you or you might not see them, and so the reaction skews like that. Doesn't ever mind.

Conor: Okay. So, sort of related, what does it then mean to be a man?

Lars: Be a man?

Conor: Yeah.

Lars: Um, I guess it depends on the point of view, but for me I guess, whatever you say I guess.

Conor: What do you say?

Lars: To me it's just more being a good person, more than anything else. Respectful.

Conor: Respectful.

Lars: I don't know if I could actually put words to the entirety of the concepts revolving masculinity, because it is such a large social construct and kind of have conflicting views on it, kind of.

Conor: What are those conflicting views?

Lars: Just, basically acknowledging masculinity and genitals, and how they exist and also wanting them not to exist, and wanting to disregard them.

Conor: Yeah, so that was a really big abstract question, what about in your own life what sort of masculine characteristics do you think you have?

Lars: Masculine? Um, I don't really know if I have too many. I mean, I guess being physically strong, I guess that's one. Honestly I don't think that there's much that I do that I would say fits... I guess I work at a restaurant and a higher percentage of men work at restaurants but I don't really know if that's masculine. 

Conor: What about on the other side? Are there any feminine characteristics that you have? 

Lars: Oh, plenty. I try to be, you know, considerate, careful, more detail oriented. Lot of traditionally feminine hobbies, love to cook for people, I enjoy decorating, doing stuff like that. 

Conor: Yeah, okay.

Lars: So, I mean, honestly, in an ideal world, I'd love to be like a house husband. 

Conor: *laughter* Yeah? What do you mean by that?

Lars: Uh, like a home-maker. I think that's the word. But, you know, handling food, food, cleaning, that kind of thing.

Conor: Taking care of kids?

Lars: Oh yeah, totally, I'd love to have kids one day.

Conor: Okay. I think that's all for my interview, I'm going to stop the recording.
