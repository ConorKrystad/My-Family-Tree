Conor: Hi Dad, hi Peter Krystad, I've got some questions about masculinity to ask you. Who was one of you idols growing up?

Peter: Idols?

Conor: Idols.

Peter: Like someone I knew or...

Conor: Family, T.V., sports, whatever.

Peter: Um, I like the scoutmaster of our scout troop, Mr. Scrugs.

Conor: Mr. Scrugs?

Peter: Jack Scrugs, yeah.

Conor: What did you like about him?

Peter: He was a leader, he was the guy who ran the troop, nobody ever questioned anything he said. He just did, made all the decisions and tended to make the right decisions and things worked out, did fun stuff. He handled, like, discipline situations really fairly, I thought. At a time when I, you know, as a sixteen or seventeen year old I felt that a lot of adults that I was encountering were not fair, and he was fair.

Conor: How so?

Peter: Well, you know, punishment fit the crime, he knew when to forgive and when to be strict. 

Conor: Okay. What are some of your hobbies?

Peter: Hobbies? I like to hike. I like to ski. I like gardening and do landscaping. I like to read. and I like to cook too, not all the time, but when I do I like to make stuff that’s new and fun, or old fashioned and fun.

Conor: Do you consider those hobbies manly?

Peter: You know, not really, I mean some of them, sure, hiking and skiing, but those pretty equal gender now, they used to be more manly but now more evenly divided. I have a bunch of hobbies that are probably I mean, I make pickles and I make jelly, I can use a sewing machine to repair things. None of those things are considered to be traditionally very many, but that doesn't bother me. They're just tools, tools and projects.

Conor: What does it mean, to you, to be a man?

Peter: Well I guess it means to me that you're the last line of defense, if nobody else is going to do it, you've got to do it.

Conor: Up to any task.

Peter: Yeah, yeah, doing the hard jobs, the tedious jobs. But also, kind of comes back to Jack Scrugs, the leadership thing. A man's job is also to help guide other men, I mean a man's job is equally important to guide women, but in particular he has to guilde men because they don't take direction from women very well. 

Conor: Okay.

Peter: So nobody else would be doing it.

Both: *laughter*

Conor: What are some masculine characteristics that you have?

Peter: Well, let's see, I'm a little stubborn.

Conor: *laughter*

Peter: Okay, maybe really stubborn, but stubborn is just a negative word for persistent. And you know, finishing. I like to try and be a little tough. If the weather is bad or it's not that fun, I like to finish things regardless. I don't know, I guess the whole cancer thing taught me about endurance. *pause* But I don't know, there's also an angle of accepting, accepting help is important too.

Conor: Yeah, okay.

Peter: Although, I don't think men are very good about that. Well maybe they are good at that, just not so good at acknowledging it.

Conor: Okay, and the last question, do you have any feminine characteristics? If so, what are they?

Peter: I would say that my most feminine characteristic is that I really enjoy the company of women. So I have lots of women that are friends and I don't have any problem hanging out with a group of women, it doesn't bother me at all. I think when you can sit around with three or four women and kind of talking in the way that women do, I can sit through that, or participate in that as much as I try to or am allowed to. And a lot of men just can't be bothered with that at all.

Conor: I've found that to be similar with me. Well more than the majority of my friends are women.

Peter: You know, it's been pointed out to me that my respect for my mother is reflected, is the same behavior, if you like the company of your mother. 

Conor: Oh yeah, I've not heard that before.

Peter: At another angle, my father is not Jack Scrugs. NOt a super strong leader, not super assertive in his relationship with my mother, and that leads to a real acceptance of female leadership and female power, that's not the right word "power", but responsibility, or female leadership, a mom that's more the leader of the family. And in many families the father is a strong powerful leader and the woman is the right hand man.

Both: *laughter*

Peter: And that leads to a different behavior on the male children, as they tend to follow the father more strongly. I think in our family it's set a little differently, in that, Mom and Dad had three sons and all three sons have relatively, you know, their wives sort of run the show. Mom and I fight over it a lot, Steph runs the show at her house, and Heather was certainly running the show at her house. And Mom, she's definitely far more of a leader than I am, but that's sort of a reflection of the family we were raised in. 

Conor: Interesting, that's interesting. 

Peter: But it's not particularly feminine to like the company of women. Maybe, I mean, asking a man "what are your feminine traits?” is sort of a weird question, because feminine traits are traits that women have.

Conor: Would you say that there isn't a firm line between what is a femine trait and what is a masculine trait?

Peter: Oh I think it used to be you never questioned, if you like to sew you're feminine. But I don't think that's true anymore, I think people can do whatever they want. You can find a place where it's still the old way, but it's not in North Seattle. 

Both: *laughter*

Conor: But it's not in North Seattle. 

Peter: But feminine? What else do I do? I like hot baths, fuzzy flannel sheets.

Conor: Scented candle?

Peter: I like nice china with matching glassware. Household stuff, I love Crate & Barrel the store. You know, that's stereotypically feminine. If you think about it, it's just the material things you like. You know, I also like bicycles and skis. To me they're all tools. Have you seen my matching power tools?

Conor: I have yeah, the green ones.

Peter: Yeah, they match the same way I like the glasses to match.

Conor: Those are my set of questions. Thank you very much.
